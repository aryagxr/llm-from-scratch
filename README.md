# Large Language Model from Scratch

This repo is for me to practice implementing large language models from scratch.

## Acknowledgement
This implementation is guided by the book [Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.
